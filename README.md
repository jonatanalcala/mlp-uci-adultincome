# MLP Application on UCI Adult Income Dataset

This project implements and evaluates an MLP algorithm using the **UCI Adult Income dataset** to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K/year. This is a python based project primarily using PyTorch for building the model.

## Results

**MLP Implementation**
- We built a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch and iteratively tuned its hyperparameters (hidden layer sizes, dropout, activation functions, learning rate).

- After comparing multiple candidate architectures, we selected a balanced final model with **two hidden layers of sizes 256 and 128**, **ReLU activations**, **dropout of 0.30**, and **Adam optimizer** with **learning rate 0.001**.

- This final model achieved **~85% validation accuracy**, maintained strong precision on the `>50K` income class, and showed stable training/validation loss behavior with only mild overfitting.

- We retrained this selected configuration for **20 epochs** on the training split and saved the resulting weights to `outputs/models/final_mlp.pt` for downstream inference and submission predictions.
